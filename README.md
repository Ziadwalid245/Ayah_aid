Ayah Aid is a website that uses the ntfy app and API.

It's made to help anyone who wants to memorize the Quran or have a watr (a number of ayahs that someone would like to recite daily).
this website uses the Quran API to fetch its data. 
it allows you to pick how many Ayahs you would like to recieve .
(I'm working adding a database to allow users to sign-up and make their own surahs, as well as allowing them to pick a time so that they recieve their notifcation. As well as adding the option to choose an entire juz or a complete surah instead of individual ayahs.)

(Also planning to rewrite the whole thing in react, cu I heard vue won't get me a job, even tho I really liked using it to make this.)
